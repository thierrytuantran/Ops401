2. How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.
  * PKI allows my browser to trust that the website I am visiting is really operated by the owner it claims to be by having a trusted authority digitally sign a certificate validating the site's identity.
3. What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?
  * The main weakness is that any certificate authority can sign a certificate for any entity, allowing corrupt authorities to enable espionage, malware attacks, or message forgery.
