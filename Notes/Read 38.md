1. Explain how Burp Suite allows us to analyze web application traffic.
  * Burp Suite allows us to analyze web application traffic using its proxy feature which intercepts and allows editing of HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses in real-time before they reach their destinations.
2. What does the Repeater tool allow us to do with requests?
  * The Repeater tool allows us to import a web request, manually modify it, and view the response side-by-side to see the impact of minor adjustments to attempted exploits.
3. Why might this be a useful tool for an attacker?
  * This would be a useful tool for an attacker because it facilitates testing how web applications respond to unusual requests, making it easier to discover and exploit vulnerabilities.
