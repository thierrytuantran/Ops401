1. You have been made responsible for the companyâ€™s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?

    * To preserve confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the file server, I would implement access controls, encryption, backups, and high availability/redundancy.
     
2. Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.

    * Hashing generates a unique fingerprint for data that changes if data is altered; by comparing hashes you can easily verify data integrity.
  
4. How is hashing and encryption different?

    *  Hashing is a one-way function that produces a unique identifier while encryption is a two-way function that transforms data to ensure confidentiality.
