1. Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.
  * A sniffing attack involves intercepting and eavesdropping on network traffic to capture sensitive information like passwords or personal data.
2. What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?
  * The two types of sniffing attacks are active sniffing (attacker sends forged packets to redirect traffic) and passive sniffing (attacker silently monitors traffic). Active sniffing is more effective but easier to detect, while passive sniffing is harder to detect but limited to monitoring clear-text data.
3. How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?
  * Encryption protects against sniffing attacks by scrambling the data during transmission, making it unreadable to anyone who intercepts the traffic without the proper decryption key.
