1. What is the main goal of Threat Hunting and how is it different from traditional threat monitoring?
  * The main goal of threat hunting is to proactively search for threats that have entered a network, as opposed to traditional threat monitoring which relies more on reactive detection by security tools.
2. What are the four types of YARA rules and what does each one of them use to identify and classify malicious software?
  * The four types of YARA rules are: string-based (use strings in code), file metadata-based (use file attributes), hash-based (use cryptographic hashes), and network-based (use network traffic data); each matches on different characteristics to identify malware.
3. How are YARA rules similar to how Anti-Virus programs detect malicious software?
  * YARA rules are similar to antivirus software in that they both rely on matching specific patterns or signatures to detect malicious code, with the key difference being that YARA rules are created manually while antivirus signatures are automatically generated.
