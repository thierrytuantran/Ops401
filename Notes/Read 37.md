1. What are the three common stages of the Penetration Testing process and what tasks are performed at each one?
  * The three common stages of the Penetration Testing process are: Explore - learn about the system being tested; Attack - exploit known or suspected vulnerabilities; Report - report back the results, vulnerabilities found, exploits attempted, and severity.
2. Explain a “main-in-the-middle proxy” in non-technical terms.
  * A "man-in-the-middle proxy" stands between the tester's browser and web application to intercept and inspect messages between them before forwarding to the destination.
3. What are the 2 spiders available for use in ZAP?
  * The 2 spiders available in ZAP are the traditional ZAP spider that examines HTML, and the AJAX spider that invokes browsers to follow JavaScript generated links.
4. What situations are they best suited for?
  * The traditional ZAP spider is fast and effective at exploring basic sites, while the slower AJAX spider is more effective at exploring modern sites that use JavaScript to generate links.
