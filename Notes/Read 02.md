1. Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.

- The levels of abstraction in AWS refer to the different ways of accessing computing power, from direct hardware access to virtual machines to containers to serverless functions. Higher levels take more responsibility from the user so they don't have to manage low-level details.

2. What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?

- The control plane handles deploying and managing containers while the data plane provides the actual CPU/memory capacity for containers to run on.

3. Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?

- AWS Lambda is a serverless function layer where users just upload code and AWS handles running it automatically in response to events. Lambda is special because it abstracts away all infrastructure so users don't manage any servers at all.
