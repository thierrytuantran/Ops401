1. How would you convince your organization about the importance of implementing a DLP solution?

* I would highlight major data breaches, the risk of substantial fines for non-compliance, and the need to protect sensitive customer and employee data to convince my organization to adopt a DLP solution.

2. How would you explain the three main use cases for DLP to friends or family?

* DLP helps companies comply with privacy regulations, protect valuable trade secrets and IP, and monitor improper data transfers - for example, stopping an employee from accidentally emailing customer credit card numbers.
