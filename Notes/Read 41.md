1. How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?
  * The stages of a penetration test closely mirror the Cyber Kill Chain model, which outlines the different phases of a cyberattack. Both start with reconnaissance and planning, followed by scanning for vulnerabilities, exploiting weaknesses to gain access, maintaining persistent access, and finally analyzing the results to improve defenses.
2. Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the companyâ€™s leadership. How would you lead this conversation?
  * To explain the benefits of pentesting to company leadership, I would begin by highlighting how it proactively identifies exploitable vulnerabilities in our systems and applications before real attackers can find and abuse them. I would emphasize that regular pentests provide invaluable insights into our real-world attack surface and risk exposure, allowing us to remediate weaknesses and bolster our security posture.
