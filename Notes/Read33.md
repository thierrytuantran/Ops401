1. How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?
  * Pentesting proactively looks for external vulnerabilities trying to break in, while threat hunting actively looks internally for signs of compromise that protections may have missed.
2. What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?
  * The primary objective of threat hunting is to proactively identify compromised systems that evaded protections by searching for indicators of breach across the environment.
3. Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?
  * I would advocate starting threat hunting by pointing out our SOC is reactive and we go months without realizing we've been breached, whereas active hunting would let us find compromises early, before major damage occurs.
