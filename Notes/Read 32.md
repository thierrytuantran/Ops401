1. You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.
  * As a malware analyst, my job is to dissect malicious software to understand how it works, where it came from, and how to stop it from infecting devices.
2. What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?
  * The six steps of the malware analysis process are: Capture, Build Lab, Install Tools, Record Baseline, Investigate, and Document - the mnemonic "CBIRID" can help remember the order.
3. You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?
  * I would conduct static analysis first because it quickly examines unchangeable code elements to reveal metadata and other indicators to help classify the malware before allowing it to execute.
