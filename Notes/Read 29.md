1. Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.
  * Threat modeling in non-technical terms is like a homeowner checking for risks like fire, floods, or burglars before disasters happen.
2. What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?
  * The four questions are: What are we building? What could go wrong? What are we going to do about that? Did we do a good job?
3. You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?
  * I would explain threat modeling helps us anticipate vulnerabilities early so we can address them proactively rather than reacting to threats, saving time and protecting our application.
